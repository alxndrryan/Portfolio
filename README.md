This repository holds the code for the bootstrap version of my personal portfolio website.

## Portfolio

This project is a reconstruction of my previous portfolio project. With this particular assignment, I made my website have a responsive layout using Bootstrap. With Bootstraps display utility, I was able to make components appear or disappear depending on the size of the user's screen size. Components with lesser importance would disappear as the screen became smaller. I learned how to quickly make a fluid layout for my website with the Bootstrap grid system. Overall, I learned a great deal about how Bootstraps predefined CSS classes work and how to use them effectively.




My portfolio was made to showcase my work as a Web Developer to potential employers. It has given me practice in HTML and CSS. With this website I have reached a greater understanding of how to make the layout of a page look exactly how I want it to. The website includes:

* About Me - A concise insight towards my interests

* Portfolio - Links the projects I am most proud of

* Contact - For potential employers or clients to contact me
